## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to set css units for responsive design and also learnt how to use flexbox to achieve complex layouts

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://cssgenerator.org) - This helped me for setting a custom box shadow. I really liked resource and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/override-root-font-size-for-a-better-user-experience/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use css units for responsive pages. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
